# Advent of code 2022

my solutions to the challenges proposed in this year's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

# usage

i decided to always read from stdin to make things easier, all folders have the
numer of the challenge and in every folder there is a `input.txt`, to run
anything you can pipe te desired input into `npm run
start:&lt;challengeNumber&gt;`. So if i wanted to run the second challange I would use the following command:

```sh
cat two/input.txt | npm run start:two
```
