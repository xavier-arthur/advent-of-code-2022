# Advent of code 2022

my solutions to the challenges proposed in this year's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

# Usage

I decided to always read from stdin to make things easier, all folders have the
numer of the challenge and in every folder there is a file called `input.txt`, so, to run
anything you can pipe the desired input into `npm run
start:{challengeNumber}` 

If I wanted to run the second challenge, for example, the command would be:

```sh
cat two/input.txt | npm run start:two
```
